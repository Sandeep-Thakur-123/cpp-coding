//Search in a sorted matrix where last element of row is always greater than first element of i+1 row.
// In this concept we start frome top right and compare it with our target if element > target we move left(means 1st row col 2) element because 
//everything below top-right element would be bigger than target now after moving we compare this element with target if element is greater that target than we move left(we dont move down because down are even bigger than present element)
//so we again move left now if element is smaller than target than we move downwards because in right side elements are bigger and in left side would be the smaller elements now we compare if element == target then return index.
